## Description

Welcome to Journey, a MERN-based (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) cancer blog application that aims to provide a platform for individuals battling cancer to share their personal experiences, seek support, and inspire others along their journey. As a cancer survivor, I wanted to create a side passion project that hits close to home while showcasing my coding skills!

Below is a preview of the deployed application:
